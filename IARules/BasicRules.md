# 🎨 Colors & Types Guidelines

## ❌ Never do this:
- Use raw/hex colors directly in components or styles
- Type anything with `any`
- Run terminal commands without explicitly asking first

## ✅ Always do this:
- Use only the colors defined in `utils/colors.ts`
- Use proper, explicit typing — rely on TypeScript’s type system and project interfaces
- Ask for confirmation before running any terminal command
- Keep code consistent with the established standards
